# Contribution Guidelines

Any contributions should be Mithril-related, but they might not fit into the existing categories. If you feel that a category is missing or that the structure of the links would be better served with some changes, please mention it when adding links or open a separate issue.

### When adding to this list

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `- [List Name](link)` and add a relevant description to the link itself, adhering to the enforced format for _Awesome lists_:

  - Each link description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.  
    - Example: `[AVA](…) - JavaScript test runner.`  
  - Drop all the "A" / "An" prefixes in the descriptions.
  - Consistent and correct naming. For example, Node.js, not NodeJS or node.js.

- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar, and extra whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
